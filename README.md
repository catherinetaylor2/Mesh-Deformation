# Mesh Deformation
### Created by Catherine Taylor

Coursework for computer animation and games module.

Input a traingulated mesh in a .obj function and Read_Obj can return arrays containg vertex position, normals and faces. The mesh deformation code allows the user to input and chosen mesh, select 3 handles and deform the mesh as required.

Left click to select handles and right click to choose goal position. Everything can be reset by hitting enter key.

### To do:
  
* Add in arrays for texture values in Read_Obj.
